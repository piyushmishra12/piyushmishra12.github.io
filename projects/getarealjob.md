During the destitution that was the period of the last few months for me, I came across many a job posting that seemed rather fishy to me. So, I decided to build a classifier that detects fake job postings. Thankfully, [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction) was available to work on. My entire notebook, including an outline of the thought process is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/piyushmishra1999/get-a-real-job). If you like it, please upvote it. It would help me.
