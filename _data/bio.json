    "summary": "I am an internet-educated machine learning practitioner primarily focusing on natural language processing and linguistic history. However, I also dabble in computer vision, reinforcement learning and related domains. I have had the opportunity to work alongside some reputed researchers from institutions like University of Calcutta, Indian Institute of Technology Patna, Larsen & Toubro Limited etc. Presently, I am pursuing a degree in B.Tech in Computer Science from International Institute of Information Technology, Bhubaneswar. Besides my professional interests, I also have a senior diploma in classical Tabla percussion (Delhi school) and Hindustani classical music (Gwalior school) from the reputed Prayag Sangeet Samiti, Allahabad.",
