I don't know if you know it or not but just to make it clear, this is the year 3020. Evidently, a lot of stuff has happened since the last 1000 years. Remember when people said 2020 was the year of the future? They said there'd be flying cars everywhere and what not. Well, at least they were hopeful, those na√Øve idiots. But enough about them. Forget flying cars, we have one upped them, or rather, hundred upped them, if that's a phrase. Now, people have the power to decide whether they want to live forever or not. And you want to talk about flying cars? Forget about it. Teleportation is the "flying cars" for us. What's not to like? It's fast, efficient, clean and resourceful. We don't have to wait for flights to travel, like you lot. Can you imagine the stress of it all? How much time is wasted while travelling when you can just, be there, you know? You just have to go to a teleportation station, they charge you a fee, you enter the box, you dissolve inside the box, and you are formed out of nothing in your new location. As simple as that. Anyway, how have you been? Reply soon.
