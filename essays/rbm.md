A Boltzmann Machine can be used to learn important aspects of an unknown probability distribution based on samples from the distribution. Generally, this learning problem is quite difficult and time consuming. However, the learning problem can be simplified by introducing restrictions on a Boltzmann Machine, hence why, it is called a Restricted Boltzmann Machine.
