In this article we will be exploring one of the ways to build a Convolution Neural Network from scratch in python. For that we will be using Keras API with TensorFlow backend. We will be working on the handwritten digits dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). We will be using the training and testing datasets separately as given.
