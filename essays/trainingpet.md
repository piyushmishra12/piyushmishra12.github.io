Note: This is a pre-emptive post. I, for one, am really interested in AI and its future. So, it's natural that a lot of the posts here, written by me, will focus on that, including deep learning (it is a real concept, it's not just a vague philosophical thing as I thought it to be 3 years ago), language processing, linguistic history etc. So, to save me the effort of always having to explain how AI really works, and to save you the effort of always having to read how AI really works, let us just get it over with here.
