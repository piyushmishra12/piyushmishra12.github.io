The perceptron was invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt and sought to binary classify an input data. It was inspired by the ability of the central nervous system of the humans to be able to do the tasks that we do. The perceptron was one of the building blocks of modern artificial intelligence as we know it today. It is the basis of the neural networks that we use to carry out a multitude of complex calculations and help computers try to mimic the human brain. In this article we will be diving into various algorithms that make the perceptron carry out binary classification.
