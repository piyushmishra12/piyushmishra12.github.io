This post is influenced by, and is sort of a collaboration with Csanád Póda, a Hungarian machine learning community builder and data scientist from Budapest. He is the one who gave me the starter for this post. Since he is a very people-oriented person (unlike me), his approach to data is also very people-oriented. He likes to interact with people, assess how people perceive the presented data and make its perception as effective as possible. In order to do that, one has to study, or at least, know about their biases. Now, I know everyone and their mother loves to pretend that they are always rational and neutral on every possible thing that has ever existed: politics, religion, future of AI, everything. But at the end of the day, they are just pretending. We all are biased. We all have an elephant in our brains.
