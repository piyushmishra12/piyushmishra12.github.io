I am writing this kernel mostly to explain myself how TPUs work. TPUs or Tensor Processing Units are accelerators that are specifically designed to carry out tasks related to deep learning with ease. However, just setting up TPU as the accelerator in one's Kaggle kernel is not sufficient. I, thus, try to perform a simple image classification problem on the Flowers dataset, as suggested by Phil Culliton.
