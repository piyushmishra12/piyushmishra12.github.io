Minimum Support Price or MSP refers to the minimum price at which a commodity can be sold legally. The MSP is set by the government for various commodities annually. Agricultural Produce Market Committees or APMCs are the different marketing boards established by the government. A farmer sells his/her produce via auction at the mandi established by the APMC. Retailers cannot directly buy produce from the farmers. This prevents exploitation of the farmer.
