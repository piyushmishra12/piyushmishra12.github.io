An Artificial Neural Network (henceforth ANN) is a form of computing system that vaguely resembles the biological nervous system. It is composed of very many neurons that are centres of computation and learn by a sort of hit and trial method over the course of many epochs. One can correctly say that an ANN and a perceptron function in an identical fashion. Much rather, the ANN is actually derived from the perceptron to render a more accurate output.
